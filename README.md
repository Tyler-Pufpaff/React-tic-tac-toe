tic-tac-toe game built using REACT

## How It's Made:

Tech Used: REACT, Javascript, CSS, HTML


## Optimizations

Moved some shared fuction variables to global component variables for conciseness.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned a bit more about immutability. I specifically built this REACT tic-tac-toe so that I could build and learn a certain useState usage in which I could go back to any player turn in the past as it is something I want to utilize in a Three.js project I am working on.
